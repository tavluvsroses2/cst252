            <h1>Lab 16: Libraries & Intro to jQuery</h1>


              <h2>Challenges</h2>

                <p>Create an index.html for your lab</p>
                <p>Link to the latest version of jQuery in the head:
                  "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"</p>
                <p>Create a JavaScript file using jQuery</p>
                <p>Create a button element (in jQuery, NOT In your HTML).
                    Give it a text label.
                    Add it to your output div.
                    Add a click event to it that will bring up an alert.
                    Restyle the button with jQuery so it is a pleasant green.</p>

              <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>At 1st the button did not show up in the output div. I was because my file name was incorrect.</p>
                <p>Still the button wasn't showing up. So we checked w3 schools to see if we were creating a new element correctly.</p>
                <p>We had a typo at the end of our appending code.</p>
                <p>We couldn't figure out how to Create the button using JQuery. We tried multiple methods and nothing seemed to work and there was nothing in the lecture or w3 schools that clearly explained how to do it. The console reported no error messages that helped explain.</p>


              <h2>Results</h2>

                </div>
                <h3>Output</h3>
                  <div id="output">
                    <button id="btn1">Press Me!!</button>
                  </div>
                </div>
